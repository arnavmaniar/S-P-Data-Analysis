# J-Term 2024 Data Science w/ R Final
I chose to work with S&P 500 Data because there was an abundance of data and I could clean/visualize lots of different ways. I was also very interested in the specific % point gains and losses specifically within the 2008 GFC so I wanted to see the greatest losses/gains within that period specifically, hence the best/worst 30 days.
